# Plan Kubernetes CIDR blocks under VPC {#concept_izq_sg4_vdb .concept}

Generally, you can select to create a Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) automatically and use the default network address when creating a Kubernetes cluster in Alibaba Cloud. In some complicated scenarios, plan the Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) address, Kubernetes pod address, and Kubernetes service address on your own. This document introduces what the addresses in Kubernetes under Alibaba Cloud VPC environment are used for and how to plan the CIDR blocks.

## Basic concepts of Kubernetes CIDR block {#section_oy4_yg4_vdb .section}

The concepts related to IP address are as follows:

**VPC CIDR block**

The CIDR block selected when you create a VPC. Select the VPC CIDR block from 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.

**VSwitch CIDR block**

The CIDR block specified when you create a VSwitch in VPC. The VSwitch CIDR block must be the subset of the current VPC CIDR block, which can be the same as the VPC CIDR block but cannot go beyond that range. The address assigned to the ECS instance under the VSwitch is obtained from the VSwitch CIDR block. Multiple VSwitches can be created under one VPC, but the VSwitch CIDR blocks cannot overlap.

The VPC CIDR block structure is as follows.

**Pod CIDR block**

Pod is a concept in Kubernetes. Each pod has one IP address. You can specify the pod CIDR block when creating a Kubernetes cluster in Alibaba Cloud Container Service and the pod CIDR block cannot overlap with the VPC CIDR block. For example, if the VPC CIDR block is 172.16.0.0/12, then the pod CIDR block of Kubernetes cannot use 172.16.0.0/16,  172.17.0.0/16, or any address that is included in 172.16.0.0/12.

**Service CIDR block**

Service is a concept in Kubernetes. Each service has its own address. The service CIDR block cannot overlap with the VPC CIDR block or pod CIDR block. The service address is only used in a Kubernetes cluster and cannot be used outside a Kubernetes cluster.

The relationship between Kubernetes CIDR block and VPC CIDR block is as follows.

## How to select CIDR block {#section_hjk_dh4_vdb .section}

**Scenario of one VPC and one Kubernetes cluster**

This is the simplest scenario. The VPC address is determined when the VPC is created. Select a CIDR block different from that of the current VPC when creating a Kubernetes cluster.

**Scenario of one VPC and multiple Kubernetes clusters**

Create multiple Kubernetes clusters under one VPC. In the default network mode \(Flannel\), the pod message needs to be routed by using VPC, and Container Service automatically configures the route table to each pod CIDR block on the VPC route. The pod CIDR blocks of all the Kubernetes clusters cannot overlap, but the service CIDR blocks can overlap.

The VPC address is determined when the VPC is created. Select a CIDR block that does not overlap with the VPC address or other pod CIDR blocks for each Kubernetes cluster when creating a Kubernetes cluster.

In such a situation, parts of the Kubernetes clusters are interconnected. The pod of one Kubernetes cluster can directly access the pod and ECS instance of another Kubernetes cluster, but cannot access the service of another Kubernetes cluster.

**Scenario of VPC interconnection**

You can configure what messages are to be sent to the opposite VPC by using route tables when two VPCs are interconnected. Take the following scenario as an example: VPC 1 uses the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/16 and VPC 2 uses the CIDR block 172.16.0.0/12. By using route tables, specify to send the messages of 172.16.0.0/12 in VPC 1 to VPC 2.

In such a situation, the CIDR block of the Kubernetes cluster created in VPC 1 cannot overlap with VPC 1 CIDR block or the CIDR block to be routed to VPC 2. The same applies to the scenario when you create a Kubernetes cluster in VPC 2. In this example, the pod CIDR block of the Kubernetes cluster can select a sub-segment under 10.0.0.0/8.

**Note:** The CIDR block routing to VPC 2 can be considered as an occupied address. Kubernetes clusters cannot overlap with an occupied address.

To access the Kubernetes pod of VPC 1 in VPC 2, configure the route to the Kubernetes cluster in VPC 2.

**Scenario of VPC to IDC**

Similar to the scenario of VPC interconnection, if parts of the CIDR blocks in VPC route to IDC, the pod address of Kubernetes clusters cannot overlap with those addresses. To access the pod address of Kubernetes clusters in IDC, configure the route table to leased line virtual border router \(VBR\) in IDC.
