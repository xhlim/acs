# Node monitoring {#task_ofj_l4l_vdb .task}

Kubernetes clusters integrate with the Alibaba Cloud monitoring service seamlessly. You can view the monitoring information of Kubernetes nodes and get to know the node monitoring metrics of the Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances under Kubernetes clusters.

1.   Log on to the [Container Service console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cs). 
2.   Click Kubernetes \>**Clusters \>** \> **Nodes**in the left-side navigation pane. 
3.   Select the cluster from the Cluster drop-down list. 
4.   Click **Monitor** at the right of the node to view the monitoring information of this node.

To view the monitoring metrics in the operating system level, install the CloudMonitor component. For more information, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_64/DNCMS11863785/EN-US\_TP\_6150.md\#](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Host monitoring/Introduction to Host monitoring.md#).

Kubernetes clusters can now monitor resources by using application groups. For more information, see [EN-US\_TP\_6947.md\#](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Monitoring/Monitor resources and send alarm notifications by using resource groups.md#).
